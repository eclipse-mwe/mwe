# Contributing to Eclipse Modeling Workflow Engine

Thanks for your interest in this project.

## Project description

Welcome to the Modeling Workflow Engine wiki. the modeling workflow engine (MWE)
supports orchestration of different Eclipse modeling components to be executed
within Eclipse as well as standalone. Based on a dependency injection framework,
one can simply configure and wire up 'workflows' using a declarative XML-based
language. The project provides the runtime used to execute workflows as well as
the IDE tooling used to edit, start and debug them.
